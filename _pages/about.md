My name is Tianbai. 
I'm currently working at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany.
I play math every day.
I create pieces which solve the problems there.
Often the problems are themselves caused by other pieces, which were also written by me.
It's fair to say I know very little about anything.

Before I came to Karlsruhe, I was a Ph.D. student at Peking University and a research assistant at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.
You can find a boring list of my research outcome [here](https://xiaotianbai.com/project/research).
I'm also reachable on <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wFTQeXwAAAAJ&hl=en'>Google Scholar</a> and <a href='https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tianbai_Xiao'>ResearchGate</a>.

I'm an enthusiast of Debussy. Sometimes I do photography. I benefited a lot from the work of Hiroshi Sugimoto and Yoshihiko Ueda. I'm addicted to [Li Juan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Juan_(author)) lately.

What I'm interested in and learning these days:
<ul>
    <!--<li>Julia/Python: ★★★★☆</li>-->
    <li>Deutsch</li>
    <li>Julia</li>
    <li>Wet plate photography</li>
    <li>Cyber security</li>
    <li>Microeconomics</li>
</ul>

I feel like I'm a pure oriental from bones.
